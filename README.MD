How to execute HelloWorld.java
1. Make sure you have the lastest version of java installed .
2. Use an IDE like eclipse or Netbeans to execute code or use windows command line or 
if using a Mac or linux use terminal.
3. I will be using terminal on a Mac and won't address how to use IDEs for this tutorial.
4. Once in the command line or terminal the following steps are the same.
5. You will start in the root directory and may need to move to a different directory to 
execute your code. 
6. Use the cd command to get the directory with your file in it. For me I have them on my desktop
so i type "cd desktop", without the parenthesis.
7. Type the following command "javac HelloWorld.java" also without parenthesis and remember case 
sensitivity. 
8. If nothing happened thats ok. This means it complied without erros
9. finally type "java HelloWord" still without parenthesis and you should get the message Hello World!
10 The end.
